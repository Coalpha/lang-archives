# php

This language is actually really good.
There really isn't anything particularly wrong with it.
People like to hate on it but it seems quite good for a glorified templating
engine. So then why is it in lang-archives? It's mainly that I don't have any
plans to use it very soon. I really like that you can add types to things.
That is very appreciated. Perhaps I will try writing something in this langauge
eventually (tm).
