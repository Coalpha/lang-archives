# lang-archives

This repository is for languages that I've tried and don't want to use. Other
language experimentation is located in
[@coalpha/coalpha.github.io](https://github.com/Coalpha/coalpha.github.io).
Certain languages may move between this repo and my main repo as time goes on.

I'm going to get
[this](https://pchiusano.github.io/2014-10-11/defensive-writing.html)
out of the way.
I'm no expert and I'm not saying that I could have done any better in
constructing these languages. By very nature of this repository, I'm going to be
very whiny and pedantic. I'll basically be complaining in each language's
respective `README.md` so that I know what things bothered me and why I should
just stick to the tools that I know. Performance has been one large factor in
why I use or don't use a language. I'm sure there are plenty of reasonable
arguments about why performance doesn't matter or how I'm measuring it in the
wrong way or where's my source. Cool. As you may have guessed, this repository
*isn't* about being reasonable, since I'm literally going through programming
languages like it's wine tasting or something.
