*Gets RSI from pressing `:` and `;` so much*

The syntax is not bad, actually. It's quite simple.
That makes reading through `core` way easier than if it had been written in like
C++ or something. You'd better get used to reading it, though, because that's
the only documentation you're going to get of the standard library.
I'm pretty sure the compiler's broken or `core:fmt` has some really weird side
effects. It's one or the other and I can't be bothered to figure out what's
going on behind the scenes. Editor support is basically only syntax highlighting
right now. No offense to Mr. Bill but I can't really see this language taking
off. It feels very Go-ish and aims to do the same things as Ziglang. I think the
Gophers are going to stick to go since this language is pretty early in
development. For people wanting a replacement to C/C++, there has been a recent
focus on fast compiled languages and I'm not sure how this language is going to
compete with the likes of Rust, Crystal or heck, even Zig. I feel like it's
going to be a bit over shadowed by these unless it can pick up a big
corperation's attention. Then again, who am I to talk? I've only spent an hour
learning it.
