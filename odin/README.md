*Gets RSI from pressing `:` and `;` so much*

The compiler is really funky with global variables.
See [odin#593](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin/issues/593).

The syntax is not bad, actually. It's quite simple.
That makes reading through `core` way easier than if it had been written in like
C++ or something. You'd better get used to reading it, though, because that's
the only documentation you're going to get of the standard library.
Editor support is basically only syntax highlighting
right now. No offense to Mr. Bill but I can't really see this language taking
off. It feels very Go-ish and aims to do the same things as Ziglang. I think the
Gophers are going to stick to go since this language is pretty early in
development. For people wanting a replacement to C/C++, there has been a recent
focus on fast compiled languages and I'm not sure how this language is going to
compete with the likes of Rust, Crystal or heck, even Zig. I feel like it's
going to be a bit over shadowed by these unless it can pick up a big
corperation's attention. Then again, who am I to talk? I've only spent an hour
learning it.
