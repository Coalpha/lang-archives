This language has probably gotten the closest to being on my "good" list out of
all the rest of them here.

### What's good

- Easy string manipulation with `&` and `$`
- Mature VSCode IDE integration (super important)
- Fast
- Windows Registry APIs in the standard library!
- Easy interop with c, I mean, it compiles to c
- Great toolchain
- Easy to use package manager
- UFCS is nice, I guess

### What's not good

The syntax looks like C and Ruby's illegitimate child.

- Significant FREAKING whitespace
- No semicolons idk what everyone's problem
- Evil `proc` syntax
- Too lose
   - `my_cat`, `MYCAT`, `mYc_AT` are all the same identifier
