# dlang

I'm pretty sure this language is magical.
Somehow, things just kinda work.
A lot of my guesses just turn out to be correct on how to do things.
I guess people spent a lot of time making it intuitive.
Learning this language is pretty frictionless.
`dmd` is super fast. Not sure about the quality of the binaries but the speed
is great for a language as high level as this.

IDE experience could certainly be a lot better.
It's better than quite a few fledgling languages but at this point,
I think D has had a lot of time to improve and I don't really see it going
anywhere fast.

JavaScript is to Dart as C++ is to dlang, I'd say.
Besides the fact that they both begin with "d", dlang is just kinda just meh.
It's better but not *that* better. I'll still keep looking into it, though.

Pain rating: A little less painful than Java
