# crystal

Maybe I should actually learn how to think about the language before making any
complaints about it. Of course it's going to be hard for me to learn how this
language works since I'm coming from JavaScript. I think I need to adopt a more
ruby-like approach to Crystal. I'll try making a small Rails application maybe.

Okay so I'm actually pretty cool with the language now but this has awful IDE
support. Especially on Windows. When types are inferred, it's your IDE's job to
help you remember what they are. Please, future me, don't come back to this
damned language.
