# crystal

I really want to like this language for some reason.
It's probably the name and Github color. Yep, I'm shallow.
I like crystal's syntax would work much better for procedural scripts than it
does for this gross OOP that they've created. From what I remember, editor
support is trash if you're on Windows because you basically have to use WSL.
I think `scry` was the best language server that's around. It takes about as
long to compile a crystal program as it does a Rust one, which is kinda
terrible. Not everyone has a powerful computer. Regardless, if I ever feel like
writing anything in this language again, all I need to do is take a look at
[`memory_game.cr`](./memory_game.cr).
