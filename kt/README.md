# kotlin

This really is a better Java.
The main problem really comes down to the tooling.
It's clear that to have a good experience with Kotlin, you're gonna be using an
IDE and Gradle. There are a lot of good ideas in here. VSCode editor support is
honestly, not the worst I've seen but it's not Java.
If JavaScript is to Dart as Java is to Kotlin. That might be a bit unfair to
Kotlin, because this truly is a nice language. It's just that right now, I'm too
stubborn to switch to a bonafide IDE to take advantage of it.

## Nice

- Companion Classes
- Lambda `it`
- `println` instead of `System.out.println`
- `when`

## Not Nice

- No semicolons with a C-like syntax
- Slow compile times
- .filter doesn't seem to remove the null type if I filter out all null values
