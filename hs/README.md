# haskell

Haskell sneers at all those non 10x-ers who can't even understand what's so
wonderful about magical functional programming. I can see *some* of the benefits
to Haskell but it just feels like I'm not smart enough to use it. Getting
something to compile is an achievement because I have no idea what I'm doing.
The big-brain ideas behind this are just too hard for me to understand.
I nearly put thirty minutes into reading about it!
